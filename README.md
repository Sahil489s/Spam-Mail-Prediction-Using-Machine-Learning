# Spam-Mail-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
*This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using text analysis techniques. Using a logistic regression model, the project effectively detects spam emails based on their content.

*Features
 Text Preprocessing: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to extract important textual features.
 Binary Classification: Logistic Regression classifies emails with high accuracy.
 Evaluation Metrics: Tracks model performance to fine-tune and improve spam detection.
 
*Getting Started
 Prerequisites
 To run the project, ensure you have Python installed and install the required libraries:
 (pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn)
 
*Dataset
 Place your email dataset file, mail_data.csv, in the working directory. This CSV file should contain:

 .Message column with email text.
 .Category column labeling emails as either "spam" or "ham."

*Installation
1.Clone the repository:

(git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-mail-prediction.gitcd spam-mail-prediction)

2.Open spam mail prediction.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to view and run the project code.

*Project Structure

 Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and checked for null values.
 
 Label Encoding: Email categories are converted to binary labels (0 for spam, 1 for ham).
 
 TF-IDF Vectorization: Email text is transformed into numerical features for machine learning.
 
 Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained to classify emails.
 
 Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated on both training and test sets using accuracy scores.
 
* Running the Project
 Load the Dataset: Verify that mail_data.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.

 Execute Cells: Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
 
* Results and Evaluation
 The model reaches a high level of accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying spam emails.

 Accuracy is evaluated on both training and test data.
 
 Additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score can be added for deeper insights.

 *Potential Improvements
 Consider the following improvements:

 Experiment with Other Models: Try using Naive Bayes or SVM for text classification.
 
 Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform cross-validation to optimize model performance.
 
 More Evaluation Metrics: Incorporate precision and recall scores for a comprehensive view.
 
*Use Cases
 This spam detection model is applicable for:

 Email Service Providers: Filtering spam in user inboxes.
 
 Businesses: Protecting users from phishing and promotional spam emails.

 Automated Moderation: Using the model in forums or messaging platforms to reduce unwanted messages.
